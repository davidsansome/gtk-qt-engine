New features and general improvements:
 * Changes in the control center module will now only affect applications inside KDE.  Applications running in GNOME can be themed separately using the GNOME tools.
 * Add a setting for emacs keyboard shortcuts.
 * When the Qt theme can't be found, display a dialog allowing the user to modify the GTK search paths.
 * Greatly improve icon loading code.
 * Add an indication for default buttons, and widgets that have keyboard focus.
 * Respect KDE's "Show icons on buttons" setting.

Buildsystem changes:
 * Switch the buildsystem from autotools to CMake.  CMake 2.4 is now required to build the project.
 * Fix a bug that would disable Bonobo support even when the correct packages were installed.
 * Fixed compilation under GCC 4.3.

Bugfixes:
 * Fix a bug that caused Qt colours not to be applied to GTK applications.  This fixes several graphical problems when using dark colour schemes.
 * Fix a bug where menu checkmarks would be displayed as a series of horizontal lines.
 * Fix OpenOffice detection on Fedora Core.
 * Fix appearance of scrollbar sliders in the Domino widget style.
 * Setting a font with bold or italic options now works correctly.
